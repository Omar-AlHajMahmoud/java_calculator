## Technology Stack

### **Core Technologies**
- **Java 17**: Primary programming language
- **JavaFX 17**: Modern GUI framework
- **Maven**: Build tool and dependency management

### **Testing Framework**
- **JUnit 5**: Unit testing framework
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for testing
- **Maven Surefire**: Test execution and reporting

### **Design Patterns**
- **Strategy Pattern**: Polymorphic mathematical operations
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic operation creation
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of UI, logic, and data

## Key Features Explained

### **Dual Interface Architecture**
The application supports both GUI and CLI interfaces, demonstrating:
- **Interface Abstraction**: Common business logic shared between interfaces
- **User Experience**: Different interaction models for different use cases
- **Code Reusability**: Core calculation engine used by both interfaces

### **Professional Testing**
```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Should handle division by zero")
void testDivideByZero() {
    ArithmeticException exception = assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
        division.calculate(5.0, 0.0);
    });
    assertEquals("Cannot divide by zero", exception.getMessage());
}
```

### **Design Pattern Implementation**
```java
// Strategy Pattern - Polymorphic operations
public interface Operation {
    double calculate(double firstNumber, double secondNumber);
}

// Factory Pattern - Dynamic operation creation
public class OperationsFactory {
    public static Operation getOperation(String operation) {
        // Returns appropriate operation based on symbol
    }
}
```

## Testing Coverage

The project includes comprehensive testing with 69 test cases covering:

- âœ… **Mathematical Operations**: All arithmetic operations with edge cases
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Division by zero, invalid inputs, null handling
- âœ… **User Interface**: Button clicks, keyboard input, state management
- âœ… **Integration**: Factory pattern, engine-operation integration
- âœ… **Edge Cases**: Large numbers, small numbers, decimal precision

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test categories
mvn test -Dtest=AdditionTest
mvn test -Dtest=CalculatorEngineTest

# Run with detailed output
mvn test -Dsurefire.useFile=false
```

## Custom Styling

The GUI features custom CSS styling with:
- **Modern Design**: Gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, shadows
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, button animations
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent color scheme and typography
- **Responsive Feedback**: Visual feedback for user interactions

## ðŸ”§ Build & Development

### **Maven Commands**
```bash
# Compile the project
mvn compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Package the application
mvn package
